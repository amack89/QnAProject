# QnAProject

This is a multiple-choice quiz web app. It asks 15 career-related questions, each with three answer options:

1. Yes (score: 1.0)
2. Somewhat (score: 0.5)
3. No (score: 0.0)

At the end, your total score is displayed.

## How to Use

- Open `docs/index.html` in your browser to take the quiz.
- All app files are in the `docs` folder for easy deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages or Cordova/Capacitor for Android).


## For Development

- To run with Node.js (for development), use:
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
  (This runs the JavaScript file, but the quiz is designed for the browser.)
